    "# Gender Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In an attempt to analyze the way in which movie characters speak about male characters versus female characters, we try to classify the gender of the character being spoken about in a particular movie line sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an outline of our approach:\n",
    "1. Process the `data/movie_lines.txt` file from the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus.\n",
    "    * Perform sentence segmentation on each movie line to determine where the sentence boundaries are for each line\n",
    "    * Separate each sentence of a movie line onto its own row in a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "    * Tokenize each movie line sentence to obtain a list of words for each sentence.\n",
    "    * For each movie line sentence, determine whether there is a 'he' or 'she' pronoun in it.\n",
    "2. Write all 23990 sentences with 'he' (and not both 'he' and 'she') to `data_processed/movie_line_sentences_tokenized_he.txt`.\n",
    "3. Write all 10735 sentences with 'she' (and not both 'he' and 'she') to `data_processed/movie_line_sentences_tokenized_she.txt`.\n",
    "4. To achieve gender parity, use all 10735 of the 'she' sentences, and randomly choose 10735 of the 'he' sentences to be in the dataset used for this classification task. Write those 10735 'he' sentences to `data_processed/movie_line_sentences_tokenized_he_selected.txt`.\n",
    "5. Build a vocabulary of all the words in those 10735 'he' sentences and 10735 'she' sentences.\n",
    "    * Write this vocabulary to `data_processed/movie_line_sentences_vocab.txt`, where each vocab word should appear on its own line.\n",
    "6. Limit the vocab size to the top 10000 vocab words after removing the 100 most common stop words.\n",
    "    * 'he' and 'she' are included in the 100 most common stop words, so this also helps us avoid using 'he' or 'she' as features.\n",
    "    * 'he' is generally used to describe men and 'she' is generally used to describe women, so we didn't want to include these two pronouns as features in our model, since it would not tell us much about the words used to describe male characters versus female characters if 'he' and 'she' were the most important features in our model.\n",
    "7. For each movie line sentence, obtain a feature vector. Use the counts of each unigram in the sentence as bag-of-words features. Populate a scikit-learn sparse feature matrix with the feature vectors for all 10735 'he' sentences and 10735 'she' sentences. The first 10735 feature vectors of the feature matrix are for the 'he' sentences, and the last 10735 feature vectors are for the 'she' sentences.\n",
    "8. Create a ground truth list of 0 and 1 labels, where the first 10735 labels are 0's, and the last 10735 labels are 1's.\n",
    "    * 0 is for 'he'\n",
    "    * 1 is for 'she'\n",
    "9. Create a scikit-learn Multinomial Bayes Naive Classifier.\n",
    "10. Perform 10-fold cross validation using scikit-learn's `cross_val_predict` function, passing in the feature matrix, the ground truth label list, and 10 as the number of folds. Write binary predictions (0 or 1) and prediction probabilities for all 10735 'he' sentences and 10735 'she' sentences to `data_processed/movie_line_sentences_predictions.txt` file.\n",
    "11. Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 by comparing the binary predictions in `data_processed/movie_line_sentences_predictions.txt` to the ground truth labels in our ground truth label list, matching movie line sentences by their index (which should be the same for the same sentence in the prediction file and the ground truth label list)."
